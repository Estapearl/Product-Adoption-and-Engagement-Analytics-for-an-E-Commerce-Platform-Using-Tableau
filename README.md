# Product-Adoption-and-Engagement-Analytics-for-an-E-Commerce-Platform-Using-Tableau

## Project Background

**NexaLink,** a leading technology company, launched **VendBridge**, a digital marketplace platform designed to connect buyers and sellers seamlessly in today’s fast-evolving online commerce space. Following a major pre- and post-launch marketing push, the product team set out to evaluate the app’s performance during its initial three-month launch period, a critical window to measure its adoption, engagement and overall market response.

The goal was to understand **how users interacted with the app, track key product performance metrics and identify areas that required optimization.** Although daily data on installations, sign-ups, active users, transactions, uninstalls, crashes, and time spent were available, these metrics existed only as raw data logs, making it difficult for NexaLinks's Product Team to extract meaningful insights or monitor trends effectively.

To address this, the data was modeled, analyzed, and visualized in Tableau by the **in-house analytics team.** The resulting interactive product performance dashboard provided the **product and marketing teams with real-time visibility into key adoption and engagement trends.** It enabled data-driven monitoring of user growth, activity levels, and overall product health throughout the launch period, supporting faster and more informed decision-making.

## Insights and Recommendations were provided in the following areas:

- **User Adoption and Engagement:** Tracked app installations, sign-ups, and daily active users to measure user growth and retention throughout the three-month launch period.

- **Product Performance Monitoring:** Evaluated uninstall and crash patterns to uncover technical or usability issues affecting the user experience.

- **Engagement Depth:** Analyzed average time spent per user and transaction activity to understand how deeply users interact with the platform.

- **Conversion Funnel:** Assessed install-to-signup conversion rates to gauge the effectiveness of marketing and onboarding efforts.

- **Month-over-Month (MoM) Analysis:** Incorporated MoM percentage change and trend indicators to visualize growth patterns and detect early signs of decline.

The dataset was cleaned and prepared in Google Sheets, while the final dashboard was developed in Tableau, providing the team with a unified view of product adoption and performance over the first three months of launch.
